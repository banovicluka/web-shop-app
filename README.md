In the practical part of the work, a simple web shop system is implemented. The system is designed to allow users to browse, buy, and sell various products or services. The main goal of this system is to provide users with a platform for efficient trading and product exchange, with support for filtering, searching, and communication among users. In addition to facilitating the buying and selling process, this system also provides an administrative application that enables management of product categories, users, and statistical data on system usage. Additionally, there is support for a customer support application that enables efficient communication between users and support. The following functionalities are briefly described in the work: registration and account activation, system login, browsing offers for users without accounts and logged-in users, viewing details of a single product/service, filtering and searching offers, leaving comments and communication among users, purchasing and recording of purchases, creating, managing, and deleting offers, administrator functionality, and functionality related to customer support.

The system architecture is three-tiered. Within the application, a MySQL database is used, the backend or service side of the application is implemented in Java Spring. The presentation or frontend layer consists of three applications: the web shop application implemented using the Angular framework, the administrative application implemented using JSP M2 technology, and the customer support application implemented using JSP.
